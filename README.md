## Introduction

In this study a hierarchical modeling framework is used to disentangle the toxicity of complex metal mixtures by carrying out a screening study of 92 drinking well water samples containing multiple metal elements.
The main objective of this study is to determine the neurodevelopmental impacts of exposure to these drinking water samples. This is achieved by conducting a larval zebrafish assay and fitting a Linear Mixed Model (LMM), as well as exploring alternative modeling approaches such as the Bayesian Linear Mixed Model (BLMM).
